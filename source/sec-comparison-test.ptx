    <title>The Comparison Tests</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            For each of the following series, determine if the series converges or diverges. You
            must use a test or a well-known series (i.e. geometric, telescoping, etc.) to prove the
            convergence AND divergence. If the series is a well-known series that the value of the
            convergence can be found, then find the value of convergence.

                    Use the direct comparison test to prove convergence. Note that 
                    <m>2^k &lt; 2^k + k</m> for all <m>k &gt; 1</m>.

                    Since the Divergence Test is inconclusive, and the series does not look
                    to be easily integrable, we will consider the comparison tests. For this
                    series, the direct comparison test is a good candidate because 
                    <m>2^k &lt; 2^k + k</m>, which means that <m>\frac{1}{2^k+k} &lt; \frac{1}{2^k}</m>.
                    Moreover, we know that <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k}</m> converges
                    because it is a geometric series where <m>r=1/2</m>. Therefore, 
                    <me>
                        \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k + k}\leq\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k} = 1
                    </me>
                    So, we can conclude by the direct comparison test that <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^k + k}</m>
                    also converges.
